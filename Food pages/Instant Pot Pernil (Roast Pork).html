                <h3>For the chicken and marinade:</h3><br>

                4 1/2 to 5 pounds skin-on boneless Boston or pork butt<br>
                1 large lime, juiced (about 2 1/2 tablespoons)<br>
                1/4 cup recaito (sofrito) (homemade or store-bought)<br>
                10 cloves garlic, peeled and mashed into a paste (2 tablespoons)<br>
                1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon adobo con pimienta, divided<br>
                1/2 tablespoon granulated onion powder<br>
                1/2 tablespoon dried oregano<br>
                1 teaspoon black pepper<br>
                1 packet sazón<br>
                For the Instant Pot<br> <br>

                1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
                1/2 cup water<br>
                1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)<br>
                1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)<br>

            <div class="container-4">
                <h1 class="hist">Method</h1>
                <p class="histdes"><br>
                    Prepare the pork:<br>
                    Rinse the pork butt, dry the surface with paper towels, and place the pork butt on a platter or<br>
                    large bowl.<br> <br>

                    Use the tip of a sharp knife to poke 1-inch slits all over, but don't poke holes through the skin.<br>
                    Run your knife between the meat and the skin to create a small pocket—you'll rub marinade under the<br>
                    skin later.<br> <br>
                    Fat Trimmed from Pork Shoulder for Instant Pot Pernil Recipe<br>
                    Drizzle lime juice over the pork:<br>
                    Drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons fresh lime juice all over the pork, making sure to rub it inside the<br>
                    pocket you just created. Allow the lime juice to penetrate the meat while you prepare the marinade.<br> <br>

                    Make the marinade:<br>
                    In a small bowl, stir the recaito, garlic paste, 1 tablespoon of adobo, granulated onion powder,<br>
                    dried oregano, black pepper, and the sazón. The mixture will form a loose paste.<br> <br>

                    Bowl of Pernil Marinade<br>
                    Rub the marinade on the pork:<br>
                    Use your hands or the back of your spoon to rub the marinade on the pork, including inside the<br>
                    pocket under the skin.<br>
                    <br>
                    Marinade Slathered on Pork Shoulder for Instant Pot Roast Pork Recipe<br>
                    Marinate the pernil:<br>
                    Transfer the pernil into a lidded container or gallon-sized zip top bag. Marinate it in the
                    refrigerator for 12 hours.<br>
                    <br>
                    Pork Shoulder Marinating in a Ziploc Bag<br>
                    Sear the pernil:<br>
                    Remove the pernil from the fridge 20 minutes before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature.<br>
                    Just before searing, sprinkle the pork with the remaining 1 teaspoon adobo.<br>
                    <br>
                    Select the sauté setting on your instant pot. If yours has the option, set it to high. When the
                    display reads "hot,” add the vegetable oil.<br> <br>

                    Place the pernil in the pot using tongs and sear the meat for 3 minutes on three of its four sides
                    for a total of 9 minutes. Don't sear the side with the skin.<br><br>

                    Transfer the seared pernil to a platter.<br>
                    Instant Pot Heated for Pernil Recipe<br>
                    Roast Pork Seared in Instant Pot<br>
                    Deglaze the pot:<br>
                    After removing the pernil from the pressure cooker, press the cancel button. Pour 1/2 cup water, 1/4<br>
                    cup lime juice, and 1/4 cup lemon juice into the pot. Use a flat-edged spoon to scrape up the<br>
                    browned bits from the bottom.<br>

                    Instant Pot Deglazed with Citrus Juice Mixture<br>
                    Return the pernil into the pot:<br>
                    Use tongs to return the pernil to the pot with the skin facing up.<br>
                    <br>
                    Pressure cook the pernil:<br>
                    Cover the pot and secure the lid. Make sure the pressure regulator is sealed.<br>

                    Set it to pressure cook on high pressure for 1 hour. It will take about 10 minutes to come up to
                    pressure.<br>
                    Instant Pot Pernil Cooking for 1 Hour<br>
                    Release the pressure:<br>
                    After the cooking time is over, allow the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes.<br>

                    Then, carefully press the release valve to completely de-pressurize the pot—I use a kitchen towel or<br>
                    mitts. Remove the lid and use tongs to transfer the pernil onto a sheet pan.<br>
                    Pressure Released from Instant Pot
                    Instant Pot Pernil
                    Crisp the skin:<br>
                    Set the oven broiler to low. Place the pernil under the broiler and allow the skin to crisp for 5 to
                    8 minutes, until dark, crisp, and blistered.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    SIMPLE TIP!<br>
                    The broiler may create a lot of smoke, so I recommend turning on the exhaust fan or opening all your<br>
                    windows.<br>

                    Rest the pernil, then serve:<br>
                    Allow the pernil to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Then, use a sharp knife to cut it into 1/4-
                    to 1/2-inch slices. Ladle some of the cooking juice from the pot over the sliced meat.<br>
                    Instant Pot Pernil on a Platter<br>
                    Store leftovers and reheat:<br>
                    Refrigerate leftovers, including the cooking juices, in a lidded container for up to 3 days.<br>

                    To reheat, portion out the desired amount of meat and heat it until warmed through in a<br>
                    microwave-safe container with some of the cooking juice drizzled on top.<br>

                    You can also heat the pernil in a skillet. Bring some of the cooking juices to a simmer over medium
                    heat, then add the sliced meat. Heat for about 5 minutes, until warmed through.<br>
