                With seasoned ground beef and American cheese on a hoagie roll with toppings, it's a filling handheld
                meal.
                Replicate chopped cheese at home and it'll quickly gain your devotion.</p>

                <h1 class="hist">Method</h1>
                <p class="histdes"><br>
                    Cook the ground beef:<br>
                    Add your ground beef to a large, dry pot or skillet over medium-low heat. Slowly cook so the fat<br>
                    renders out. Stir regularly, breaking up the beef as it cooks, until it is in crumbles but not fully<br>
                    cooked (some of the meat will still be pink).<br> <br>

                    SIMPLE TIP!<br>
                    If you want to be authentic, you can use the side of a metal spatula to “chop” the beef as it cooks,
                    but a spoon will work, too.<br>
                    <br>
                    Add the onions, garlic, and seasoning:<br>
                    Once the beef is browned and most of the fat has rendered out (about 7-8 minutes of cooking), turn<br>
                    the heat up to medium and add onions and garlic. Cook for another 4-5 minutes until vegetables
                    soften. Season the filling with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Remove from heat.<br> <br>

                    Cooked Ground Beef Filling for NYC Chopped Cheese<br>
                    Toast the buns:<br>
                    Slice your rolls in half and toast them in batches over a griddle or in a large skillet over medium<br>
                    heat until browned.<br> <br>
                    Combine the cheese and ground beef:<br>
                    For each sandwich, portion out about 1/6 of the beef filling at a time and add to the griddle or<br>
                    skillet over medium-low heat. Let the filling get hot and then cover it with two slices of American<br>
                    cheese. Let it sit long enough got the cheese to melt. If you like, roughly “chop” the cheese into<br>
                    the beef mixture with the side of a metal spatula.<br> <br>

                    Beef Filling Topped with Slices of Cheese on a Griddle for Chopped Cheese Sandwich<br>
                    Place the roll on the ground beef:<br>
                    Add 1 tablespoon of mayo to one side of your toasted roll and cover the beef filling with a toasted<br>
                    roll, by placing the roll, toasted side down, on top of the chopped beef mixture.<br> <br>

                    Sliced Hoagie Roll Placed on Top of Chopped Cheese Filling on Griddle<br>
                    Finish the sandwich and serve:<br>
                    After 30 seconds, use a spatula to flip the roll, keeping the filling inside. If any filling falls<br>
                    out, use the spatula to add it back to the roll. Repeat as needed to make other sandwiches.<br> <br>

                    Add shredded lettuce and sliced tomato to the sandwich. Cut in half and serve immediately.<br>

                    Leftover chopped cheese filling can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for 3-4 days.<br>
                    You can add the filling straight from the fridge to a griddle to make a sandwich.<br> <br>

                    Only make as many sandwiches as you need to, but if you have leftover filling, that’s great!<br> <br>
