      <p class="fooddes">this is my second or i would say the better version of rasgulla recipe. i had posted this
        recipe with video almost 3 years back which was very popular. but i was getting several queries about it and
        even i realized that i may have skipped some minor steps. hence as part of revisiting my old recipes, i am
        reposting this rasgulla recipe

        ▢4 litre milk (full cream)<br>
        ▢4 tbsp lemon juice<br>
        ▢2 cup sugar<br>
        ▢10 cup water<br>
        ▢6 pod cardamom<br>

        <h1 class="hist">Method</h1>
        <p class="histdes">
          firstly, in a large vessel get 2 litre milk of milk to a boil stirring occasionally.<br>
          once the milk comes to a boil, pour 2 tbsp lemon juice and stir well. you can alternatively use curd or
          vinegar.<br>
          stir until the milk curdles keeping the flame on low to medium.<br>
          do not boil further once water separates completely.<br>
          drain the curdled milk over a cloth-lined over a colander. you can use the leftover water to make soup or
          knead the dough as they are very nutritious.<br>
          squeeze off the water completely. be careful as the curdled milk will be very hot.<br>
          rinse off the curdled milk with fresh water to remove sourness from lemon juice.<br>
          squeeze off the water completely. do not over squeeze as the moisture in paneer will be lost.<br>
          hang for 1 hour making sure the water is drained completely, yet remain the moisture.<br>
          after 1 hour, start to mash the paneer for 5 minutes.<br>
          mash the paneer till it turns out smooth texture without any grains of paneer.<br>
          now prepare small ball sized paneer and keep aside. cover and keep to prevent from drying.<br>
          in a large vessel take 1 cup sugar, 5 cup water and 3 pod cardamom.<br>
          stir and dissolve the sugar completely.<br>
          now boil the water for 5 minutes.<br>
          drop in rolled paneer balls one by one into boiling sugar water.<br>
          cover and boil for 10 minutes or until rasgulla doubles in size.<br>
          now drop into ice-cold water immediately, to prevent from shrinking in size.<br>
          once cooled completely, take into a serving bowl and pour in leftover sugar water.<br>
          finally, enjoy rasgulla chilled or as it is.<br>
