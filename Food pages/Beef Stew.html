                <h3></h3><br>
                3 pounds well-marbled beef chuck stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces <br>
                3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more to taste<br>
                3 tablespoons olive oil<br>
                5 ribs celery, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups)<br>
                1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 cup)<br>
                4 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups)<br>
                2 medium parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 1 cup) <br>
                1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>
                1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves<br>
                1 tablespoon all-purpose flour<br>
                4 cups beef broth (see recipe note)<br>
                2 cups water<br>
                1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar<br>
                1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br>
                1 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 3 cups)<br>
                1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley leaves<br>
                </p>
            </div>

                <h1 class="hist">Method</h1>
                <p class="histdes"><br>
                    Cook the beef:<br>
                    In a large bowl, season the beef pieces with 1 tablespoon of the salt. Heat the olive oil in a large<br>
                    (6 to 8 quart), thick-bottomed pot over high heat. <br> <br> 

                    Add the beef all at once and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink and some<br>
                    liquid has accumulated at the bottom of the pot, about 10 minutes.<br> <br>

                    SIMPLE TIP!<br> 
                    Get the meat cooking as you prep the vegetables. This step isn't browning, per se; it gives the meat<br>
                    a jump-start as you ready the rest of your ingredients.<br> <br>

                    Beef Chuck Cooked in a Pot on a Stove and Stirred Using a Pair of Tongs for Beef Stew Recipe<br>
                    Add the vegetables:<br>
                    Add the celery, onion, carrots, and parsnips. Reduce heat to medium-high. Season with remaining<br>
                    teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has<br>
                    evaporated and vegetables are slightly softened, about 10 minutes more.<br> <br>

                    Add the thyme and flour, stir, and cook until raw flour is no longer visible, about 30 seconds.

                    Beef Stew Ingredients Mixed Together in the Pot on the Stove and Seasoned with Herbs
                    Add the broth and simmer:<br>
                    Add the beef broth, water, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring mixture to a boil, then<br>
                    reduce heat to medium-low and cook, partially covered and stirring every 20 minutes or so, until<br>
                    stew has darkened and thickened slightly, about 1 hour.<br> <br>

                    Broth Added to Pot of Easy Beef Stew on the Stove<br>
                    Add the potatoes and finish:<br>
                    Add potatoes to the stew, stir well, and continue to simmer until the potatoes and beef are tender,<br>
                    about 30 minutes. Season to taste, transfer to serving bowls, sprinkle with parsley, and serve.<br> <br>

                    Refrigerate leftovers, tightly covered, for up to 5 days.<br>

                    SIMPLE TIP!<br>
                    Because stewed potatoes do not freeze well, we don’t recommend freezing this recipe.<br>
