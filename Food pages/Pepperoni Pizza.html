                <h3>For the herb pizza sauce:</h3><br>

                1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce<br>
                1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil<br>
                1 teaspoon kosher salt<br>
                1 teaspoon dried basil<br>
                1 teaspoon dried oregano<br>
                1 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
                1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br>
                For the pizza<br> <br>

                1 pound fully risen pizza dough<br>
                Flour, for dusting the counter<br>
                10-12 large-diameter (about 1 1/2 inches) pepperoni slices<br>
                12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella, shredded (about 3 cups)<br>
                Fresh basil leaves, for garnish<br> <br>

                <p class="histdes"><br>
                    Preheat the oven to 500˚F:<br>
                    If you’re using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven so it gets nice and hot.<br> <br>

                    Make the herb pizza sauce:<br>
                    In a medium bowl, stir together all of the herb pizza sauce ingredients until they’re combined. Set<br>
                    aside.<br> <br>

                    SIMPLE TIP!<br>
                    You’ll have leftover sauce if you made yours from scratch, but it freezes well.<br> <br>

                    Bowl of Pizza Sauce with Some on a Raised Spoon for Heart-Shaped Pepperoni Pizza Recipe<br>
                    Shape the pepperoni:<br>
                    Fold each pepperoni in half, then use a paring knife or kitchen scissors to cut an angle off near<br>
                    the top of the fold. Then trim around the edge to form the point of the heart. Save all of your<br>
                    pepperoni trimmings—you’ll use them!<br> <br> 

                    Large Circular Pepperoni Cut into Heart Shapes for Heart-Shaped Pepperoni Pizza Recipe<br> 
                    Shape the pizza dough:<br> 
                    Roll out the pizza dough into a large circle, at least 12 inches in diameter, on a lightly floured<br> 
                    surface. You have two options for shaping into a heart:<br>  <br> 

                    Option 1: Use a dough scraper, kitchen scissors, or pizza cutter to carve a heart out of the dough.<br>
                    This results in a cleaner looking heart, but you lose some dough.<br> <br>

                    Option 2: Use your hands to shape the dough into a rough heart. You’ll keep more dough and have a<br>
                    thicker crust, but it’s hard to get a really well-defined heart this way.<br> <br>

                    Pizza Dough Shaped into a Heart for Pepperoni Pizza Recipe<br>
                    Top the pizza:<br>
                    Slide the shaped dough onto a pizza peel that’s dusted with flour. Spread 1/2 cup of the herb pizza<br>
                    sauce over the surface of the dough and top it with the reserved pepperoni trimmings. Sprinkle on a<br>
                    layer of shredded cheese, and the heart-shaped pepperoni slices.<br> <br>

                    SIMPLE TIP!<br>
                    If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can assemble and bake the pizza on a large baking sheet greased<br>
                    with oil.<br> <br>

                    Heart-Shaped Pepperoni Pizza Topped with Shredded Mozzarella and Heart Shaped Pepperoni Pieces<br>
                    Bake and serve:<br>
                    Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone using a pizza peel and bake the pizza on the pizza stone for<br>
                    10-12 minutes until golden brown around the edges and melted in the center (a pizza baked on a<br>
                    baking sheet will take longer, about 14-15 minutes).<br> <br>

                    Garnish with fresh basil leaves. Let the pizza cool briefly, slice it, and serve.<br> <br>
