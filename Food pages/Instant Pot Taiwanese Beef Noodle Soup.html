                6 cups water<br>
                For the broth<br> <br>

                3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
                2 star anise<br>
                1 (2-inch piece) fresh ginger, sliced<br>
                2 bay leaves<br>

                1/2 cup soy sauce<br>
                3 tablespoons toban djan (like Lee Kum Kee brand)<br>
                3 tablespoons chili crisp<br>
                2 tablespoons sugar<br>
                4 cloves garlic, smashed<br>
                2 teaspoons ground white pepper<br>
                3 white onions, quartered<br>
                4 roma tomatoes, quartered<br>
                7 cups water<br>
                Salt, to taste<br>
                For the toppings<br> <br>

                3 medium bok choy, sliced lengthwise<br>
                2 bundles dried wheat noodles<br>
                1 scallion, sliced, to garnish<br>
                4 sprigs fresh cilantro, to garnish (optional)<br> <br>

                Special Equipment<br>
                Spice ball or cheesecloth and string<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-4">
                <h1 class="hist">Method</h1>
                <p class="histdes"><br>
                    Precook the beef shank:<br>
                    To the inner pot of the Instant Pot, add the beef shank, scallions, ginger, and star anise. Add
                    enough water to reach the 4-quart mark, about 6 cups. Lock on the lid and make sure the valve is
                    set<br>
                    to seal.<br> <br>

                    Precooking the beef shank will release the excess scum (the frothy foamy gray bits). This will
                    also<br>
                    yield a cleaner and clearer broth in the end.<br>
                    Water Added to Beef Shank, Star Anise, and Scallions in Instant Pot for Taiwanese Beef Noodle
                    Soup<br>
                    Pressure cook and cool the beef shank:<br>
                    Program the pressure cooker on the manual/pressure cooking setting for 10 minutes at high
                    pressure.<br>
                    It will take several minutes for the Instant Pot to come up to pressure before the actual cook
                    time<br>
                    begins.<br>

                    While the beef shank precooks, prepare an ice bath.<br>

                    Once the cook time is up and the Instant Pot beeps, carefully quick release the pressure with
                    the<br>
                    steam vent.<br>

                    Remove the beef shank using tongs and submerge it in the ice bath for 10 minutes. Discard the<br>
                    cooking water and rinse and dry the inner pot.<br>
                    Cooked Beef Shank Cooling in Ice Bath for Pressure Cooker Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup
                    Preheat the pot, slice the beef, and prepare the spices:<br>
                    Replace the inner pot and program the pressure cooker on the manual sauté setting at high
                    temperature. Let preheat for 5 minutes and then add the oil.<br> <br>

                    While the Instant Pot is preheating, place the beef shank on a cutting board with tapered ends
                    pointing left and right. Slice into 1/2-inch pieces.<br> <br>

                    Add the star anise, ginger, and bay leaves to a spice ball or wrap them in cheesecloth and tie up
                    the bundle with string. This will help contain the spices for easy removal at the end.<br>

                    Make the soup:<br>

                    Lock on the lid and make sure the valve is set to seal. Program the pressure cooker on the
                    manual<br>

                    Cook the bok choy and noodles:<br>
                    When there is about 15 minutes left on the Instant Pot timer, fill a large pot 2/3 with water
                    and<br>
                    bring to a boil. Add the bok choy and wheat noodles. Cook according to the noodle package<br>
                    instructions, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and drain.<br> <br>

                    Bok Choy and Noodles Boiling in Dutch Oven for Instant Pot Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup<br>
                    Vent, remove the spice ball, and serve:<br>

                    with the steam vent.<br> <br>

                    Remove the lid and remove the spice ball or cheesecloth. Season with salt, to taste.<br> <br>

                    Add the noodles, bok choy, and soup to individual bowls. Garnish with scallions and cilantro, if<br>
                    using.<br> <br>

                    The soup will last in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. The noodles and bok choy should be
                    cooked<br>
                    fresh or stored separately for up to a day. Use the Instant Pot “keep warm” function, the
                    stovetop,<br>
                    or the microwave to reheat.<br> <br>
