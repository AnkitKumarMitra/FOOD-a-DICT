                7 cups water, divided<br>
                3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste<br>
                1 large (2-pound) or 2 small (1-pound) live lobsters (see Recipe Note)<br>
                2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
                1 medium yellow onion, sliced<br>
                1 medium carrot, sliced<br>
                1 stalk celery, sliced<br>
                2 sprigs fresh thyme<br>
                1 clove garlic, sliced<br>
                2 tablespoons tomato paste<br>
                Pinch cayenne pepper or to taste<br>
                1 dry bay leaf<br>
                1 cup dry white wine<br>
                2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br>
                6 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>
                1/3 cup cream sherry<br>
                1 cup heavy cream<br>
                2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br>

                <h1 class="hist">Method</h1>
                <p class="histdes"><br>
                    Cook the lobster:<br>
                    Skip this step if using a cooked lobster. See recipe notes above for instructions on how to
                    proceed.<br> <br>

                    In an 8- to 10-quart pot set over high heat, bring 6 cups water and the salt to a boil. Add the<br>
                    lobster, head first and cover the pot with a lid.<br>
                    <br>
                    Adjust the heat to a low boil, and steam for 18 to 20 minutes for a large lobster or 15 to 18<br>
                    minutes for two small lobsters. The lobster will not be fully submerged in the water. When it’s<br>
                    done, the shell will be bright red. You should be able to twist off a leg easily.<br>
                    <br>
                    With tongs, remove the lobster and set it on a rimmed baking sheet to cool. Pour the lobster
                    cooking<br>
                    water into a second pot and set it aside for when you make the stock.<br> <br>

                    Steamed Lobster in a Pot for Lobster Bisque Recipe<br>
                    Pick the lobster meat from its shell:<br>
                    When the lobster is cool enough to handle, use a knife, kitchen shears, and if necessary, a mallet<br>
                    or lobster cracker to break or cut the shells and extract the meat. For detailed instructions, check<br>
                    out this post. It will walk you through the process. Work over the rimmed baking sheet to catch the<br>
                    juices, so you can add them to the stock later.<br> <br>

                    Lobster Deshelled Using a Mallet, Sheers, and Knife in a Baking Pan for Lobster Bisque<br>
                    Transfer the meat to a bowl:<br>
                    Transfer the lobster meat into a medium bowl. If the lobster has roe—the tiny red lobster eggs from<br>
                    a female lobster—add it too. Run your fingers through the smaller pieces of meat to find and remove<br>
                    any rogue shells.<br> <br>

                    Rinse off any tomalley—the green gunky stuff stuck to the meat—under cold running water. Pat the<br>
                    meat dry with a paper towel. Cut the large pieces of meat into smaller bite-sized pieces and<br>
                    transfer them to the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.<br> <br>

                    With your hands or kitchen shears, break or cut the shells into 2- to 3-inch pieces. These will be
                    used to flavor the stock.<br>

                    Bowl of Lobster and Lobster Roe<br>
                    Make the stock:<br>
                    Heat the same stock pot you used to cook the lobster over medium heat and add the oil. Add the<br>
                    cut-up lobster shells and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes until they turn a deeper shade of red.<br>

                    Stir in the onion, carrot, celery, thyme sprigs, and garlic. Cook stirring often for 5 minutes,<br>
                    until the vegetables soften. Stir in the tomato paste, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf. Cook and stir
                    for 2 minutes to concentrate the flavors.<br>

                    Add 5 cups of the lobster cooking water and the reserved juices on the baking sheet. If you don’t<br>
                    have the full amount of lobster cooking water, add additional water to make 5 cups of liquid.<br>

                    Add the wine and the remaining 1 cup water. Bring it to a boil then lower the heat to maintain a<br>
                    simmer. Cover the pot with a lid and cook for 45 minutes.<br>

                    Water Added to Pot for Lobster Bisque<br>
                    Strain the stock:<br>
                    Set a colander over a large bowl and strain the stock to remove the shells and aromatics. Discard<br>
                    strainer.

                    Broth Strained Again to Remove Lobster Shells Using a Fine Mesh Strainer<br>
                    Make the beurre manié:<br>
                    In a small bowl, stir the butter and flour together until combined.<br> <br>

                    Bowl of Beurre Manié<br>
                    Finish the bisque:<br>
                    Add the sherry into the strained stock and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk the beurre<br>
                    manié into the simmering stock and continue simmering for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally, until<br>
                    the beurre manié dissolves and the bisque thickens. It should be the consistency of heavy cream.<br> <br>

                    If the bisque is too thin, whisk in more beurre manié using a ratio of 1 part butter to 1 part<br>
                    flour. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes for the flour to thicken the bisque. The consistency should be light<br>
                    and creamy, not thick and heavy. If the bisque thickens too much, add more lobster stock or water, a<br>
                    little at a time.<br>

                    Add the cream and bring it to a simmer again. Stir in the lobster meat and cook for 1 to 2 minutes,<br>
                    until the lobster is heated through. Stir in the lemon juice. Taste and add more salt if you’d like.<br> <br>

                    Pot of Lobster Bisque<br>
                    Serve the bisque:<br>
                    Ladle the bisque into bowls and serve warm.<br> <br>

                    Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 2 days in a lidded container. It can be frozen for up to 3<br>
                    months, but you do run the risk of it breaking (the cream curdles and separates) when you reheat it.<br>
                    To mitigate this, slowly reheat the bisque in a pot over low heat, whisking often and diligently so<br>
                    that it stays creamy and smooth.
