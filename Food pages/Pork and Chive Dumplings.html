                    Make the dumpling filling:<br>
                    In a medium bowl, add the ground pork, Chinese chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, and sugar.<br>
                    Mix together using clean hands.<br>

                    Bowl of Ground Pork, Chopped Chives, Cornstarch, and Seasoning for Pork and Chive Dumpling Recipe<br>
                    Pork and Chive Dumpling Filling Mixed Together<br>
                    Prepare the wrapper:<br>
                    Place a square wonton wrapper in a diamond formation with the bottom corner pointing towards you.<br>
                    Cover the remaining wrappers with a damp paper towel so they donâ€™t dry out.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dip your fingertips in water and brush along the edges of the wrapper to moisten. You may have to<br>
                    dip your fingers a few times. Place a tablespoon of dumpling filling in the center of the wrapper.<br>
                    <br>
                    Pork and Chive Dumpling Wrapper (Square Wrapper) on a Counter Next to a Bowl of Water<br>
                    Tablespoon of Pork and Chive Filling in Dumpling Wrapper with Edges Brushed with Water for Dumpling<br>
                    Recipe<br>
                    Fold the dumpling:<br>
                    Fold the bottom half of the dumpling over to the top to create a triangle. Seal by pressing along
                    the edges. Dip your fingertips in water and wet the bottom two folded corners of the wrapper.
                    <br> <br>
                    Gently bring the left and right sides of the dumpling together and press the overlapped corners to
                    create a tael shape.<br> <br>

                    Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Cover the dumplings with a damp tea towel or paper
                    towel as you go.<br>
                    Dumpling Wrapper Folded in Half, over the Filling<br>
                    Two Corners of Folded Dumpling Wrapper Brought to Center Forming a Filling Bubble. Corners Brushed
                    with Water.<br>
                    Edges Pinched Together to Form a Tael Shaped Pork and Chive Dumpling<br>
                    Tael Shaped Pork and Chive Dumplings on a Cutting Board<br>
                    Steam:<br>
                    In a shallow pot, add about 2 cups of water, or enough water to actively boil without touching the
                    bottom of the steamer basket. Line the bamboo steam basket with steamer paper, parchment paper, or 8
                    cucumber slices or napa cabbage leaves and place it in the pot over the water.
                    <br> <br>
                    Place 8 dumplings in the prepared bamboo steamer equally spaced apart. Stack additional sets of
                    dumplings in bamboo baskets on top, if available. Otherwise, steam in batches.<br><br>

                    Cover and steam on high heat for 8 minutes. The dumplings will be translucent and the filling will
                    be cooked through. Replenish the water and bring it to a boil for additional steaming sessions, if
                    needed.
                    Pork and Chive Dumplings in a Lined Bamboo Steamer in a Dutch Oven<br>
                    Make the sauce:<br>
                    In a small bowl, add the Chinese black vinegar, sugar, and thinly sliced ginger. Whisk to combine.
                    <br><br>
                    Serve the dumplings hot with the sauce on the side for dipping.
